# Connect-4
This is (not yet) an implementation of the classic game of connect four. The rules are simple: There are two players, usually red and yellow, but any two colors will do. The first player is chosen at random by the game. The players take turns in placing one token in any of the available columns. If a player manages to connect four pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they are victorious.
